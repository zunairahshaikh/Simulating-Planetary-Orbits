# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

Welcome to my humble planetary orbit simulation where celestial bodies whirl around the Sun in all their cosmic glory

## 📜 What is this?
This project is a Python-based simulation of planetary motion, brought to life with the magic of Pygame. It features:
- Realistic orbital mechanics based on physics laws 🪐
- A simple, clean interface to enjoy the planetary vibes 🌠
- Beautiful trails of orbits that show the paths of the planets 🎨

## 🚀 Features
- The Sun ☀
- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars
- Orbit Trails

## 🔭 The Science Behind It

This simulation uses:
- Newton's Law of Gravitation 🌌
- Orbital Velocity Calculations 📐
- 1 AU Scaling to bring the vastness of space to your screen ✨

## 🎮 How to Run The Code
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run the code in a code editor that supports python, or run the script:
   ```
   python planetary_orbits.py
   ```
4. Enjoy! 😺
